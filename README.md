# Assistant Backend

The Assistant Backend is a project deployed to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) via [Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) to handle the backend of the Google Assistant (And possibly other assistants in the future) for [MS Paint IDE](https://github.com/MSPaintIDE/MSPaintIDE). The assistant support allows for the following things currently:

- Link accounts to MS Paint IDE securely
- Stop, Highlight, Compile, and Run your code from your voice with ~500ms delay
- Say bye to you

The backend is not done, with more features planned. If you have any suggestions, just make a PR. The Assistant client and the agent.zip will be published shortly.
